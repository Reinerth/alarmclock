# alarmclock :alarm_clock:
**A browser alarmclock with night-/light-blink-mode. Best to use on a PC with no fan and a monitor with remote control and integrated sound-speakers.**

Why?! Because I wanted an alarmclock exactly like this one. <br>
I am using a small PC without fan (no noise) and a monitor with integrated soundspeakers with remote control. If I wake up before alarm rings, I can deactivate the alarm by muting the monitor or switching it off with the remote control. I can reactivate it when I am back from work by switching the monitor on again. No empty batteries (on the mobile) anymore and still the sound I want. If I ignore the alarm, it gets silent without my interaction by a configured timerange and next day continues as set. I love this, because it is exactly as I wanted it. For me it is the perfect alarmclock. 

<br><br>
This are the possible configuration settings. (details in usersettings.js)<br>
window.alarmclock.displayLeftTime = true;<br>
window.alarmclock.displayLightAlarm = true;<br>
window.alarmclock.sound = true;<br>
window.alarmclock.displayTestSound = true;<br>
window.alarmclock.precision = 1;<br>
window.alarmclock.soundFile = "rain-at-tarp.m4a";<br>
window.alarmclock.backgroundColor = "#335577"; <br>
window.alarmclock.backgroundImage = true; <br>
window.alarmclock.backgroundImageName = "03.jpg"; <br>
window.alarmclock.timeOfAlarm = 60; <br><br>

**This is what it looks like:** <br><br>
The backgroundimage can be changed. <br>

<br><br>
The displayed left time, the light-alarm and the test-sound-button could be disabled by configuration setting.

<br><br>
The background-image can be deactivated and a background-color could be set.

The night-/light-mode I always use:

<br><br>
On night-alarm the monitor gets brighted up (blink) due to background-colorchange to white and back.
